              "2. **Mode Collapse**: Generative AI models, especially GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks), can suffer from mode collapse, where the model produces limited variations of the same output, instead of exploring the full range of possibilities.\n",
              "3. **Lack of Control and Explainability**: Generative AI models can be difficult to control and interpret, making it challenging to understand why a particular output was generated. This lack of explainability and control can make it hard to debug and fine-tune the model.\n",
              "4. **Unrealistic or Unwanted Outputs**: Generative AI models can produce outputs that are unrealistic, unwanted, or even offensive. This can be a major concern in production environments, where the outputs need to be reliable and trustworthy.\n",

This can be a limiting factor in production environments, where resources may be constrained.\n",
